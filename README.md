2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using either PyCharm or the command prompt.
     - Example command: `cd /path/to/your/.py/file` followed by `python Keysounds.py`.
     - May need to install packages:
          -from pynput import mouse
          -import pygame
          -import os

3. **Customize Key Sounds:**
   - For personalized key sounds, obtain an audio file (e.g., .mp3).
   - Rename the file to "keysound" and place it in the same directory as the .py file.

Now, your keystrokes and mouse clicks can have a unique audio touch. Feel free to explore and enjoy the enhanced auditory experience.
