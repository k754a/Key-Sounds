### Getting Started:

1. **Download the .py File:**
   - Download the provided Python script and place it in a directory of your choice.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using either PyCharm or the command prompt.
     - Example command: `cd /path/to/your/.py/file` followed by `python Keysounds.py`.

3. **Executable (.exe) Option:**
   - If you prefer, you can download the script as an executable (.exe) file. It doesn't require additional package installations, but it might be flagged by Windows Defender.

4. **Customize Key Sounds:**
   - For personalized key sounds, obtain an audio file (e.g., .mp3).
   - Rename the file to "keysound" and place it in the same directory as the .py file.

Now, your keystrokes and mouse clicks can have a unique audio touch. Feel free to explore and enjoy the enhanced auditory experience.
